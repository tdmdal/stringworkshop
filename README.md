# TDMDAL String Workshop
This Git repository includes two sets of Python code on Google Colab. The initial set serves as an introduction to using strings in Python, while the second set involves using medical text datasets for data manipulation, utilizing language models to forecast the category of a specific diagnosis.
  

The first file contains a [intro to string in Python](https://github.com/tdmdal/stringworkshop/blob/master/TDMDAL_StringWorkshp_intro2Strings.ipynb) 
The second notebook covers using a string dataset and training a model for medical description classification [advanced notebook](https://github.com/tdmdal/stringworkshop/blob/master/TDMDAL_StringWorkshop_Advanced.ipynb).
